    "* Duplicated features?\n",
    "* Duplicated rows?\n",
    "* Are any of your features highly correlated together?\n",

    "> Transforming the target variable (using the mathematical log function) into a tighter, more uniform space makes life easier for any [regression] model.\n",

    "> The only problem is that, while easy to execute, understanding why taking the log of the target variable works and how it affects the training/testing process is intellectually challenging. You can skip this section for now, if you like, but just remember that this technique exists and check back here if needed in the future.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Optimally, the distribution of prices would be a narrow “bell curve” distribution without a tail. This would make predictions based upon average prices more accurate. We need a mathematical operation that transforms the widely-distributed target prices into a new space. The “price in dollars space” has a long right tail because of outliers and we want to squeeze that space into a new space that is normally distributed. More specifically, we need to shrink large values a lot and smaller values a little. That magic operation is called the logarithm or log for short. \n",

    "- How is your target distributed?\n",

    "- Choose your evaluation metric(s).\n",
    "    - Classification: Is your majority class frequency >= 50% and < 70% ? If so, you can just use accuracy if you want. Outside that range, accuracy could be misleading. What evaluation metric will you choose, in addition to or instead of accuracy?\n",
    "    - Regression: Will you use mean absolute error, root mean squared error, R^2, or other regression metrics?\n",
    "- Choose which observations you will use to train, validate, and test your model.\n",
